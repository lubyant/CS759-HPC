pure OMP has higher performance when the array size is less than 2**22.

for a smaller size array, pure OMP is better for reduction since it requires less memory to store
and process the operation. Using MPI will lead to unecessary overhead when different nodes and machines
talk to each other.

For a larger size array, MPI+OMP is better for performance. When the array is too large, the demand for 
memory might exceeds the memory of hardware such that it needs several machines to compute. For this
case, MPI has a better performance because it allows to run the code on different machines.

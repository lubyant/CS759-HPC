Task2
(c) The overall trend is that the performance increases as the more threads increases up
to 10 threads but after 10 threads, performance roughly stays the same. The can be explained
by the Amdahl's law that multi-threads speedup has its maximum roofline no matter how many
threads you work on it. In this task, there are several factor that restrict performance. For 
example, besides the parallel block, there are still a couple of task need to proceed sequentially,
such as summation of the convulution. Another possible reason is this task can restricted by its
bandwidth such that program need to wait the data for calculation no matter how many cores you have.

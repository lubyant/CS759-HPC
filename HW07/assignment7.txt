Task 1
(d) When the size of array is relative small, I got the best performance of 
cuda computing rather than thrust or cub. While the size of array becomes huge 
like two power of 30, cub performance gets better. It seems that cub provides
somewhat better implementations than others so that it achieves best performance
However, it is finest level of implementations so the codes looks unfriendly.

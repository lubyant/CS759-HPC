(b) as shown in the plot, there is huge spike when the array size is larger than 2048. From 
the lecture, we know that this is caused by switching between eager mode and rendezvous mode. 
To estimate the bandwidth and latency, we can start with redezvous mode.

latency: latency is the intercept at figure and it should remove the eager mode. Read from the 
figure, it would be 3 ms (6 ms for two send, then divide by 2) 

bandwidth: bandwidth is the inverse of slope ratio for rendezvous mode and we can read from the figure.
bandwidth will be around 2.6 gb/s.

I am not sure about the Euler hardware but check with lecture and it shows bandwidth 
4gb/s and latency 4 um. It is roughly equal to what I have on Euler.
